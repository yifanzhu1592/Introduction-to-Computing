# Introduction-to-Computing
This repository contains programs I wrote during the modules "Introduction to Computing I" and "Introduction to Computing II" at Trinity College Dublin

I had these two modules in the Michaelmas Term & the Hillary Term, Junior Fresh Year (Semester 1 & Semester 2 in Year 1)
